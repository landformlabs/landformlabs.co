# Strava App Integration

Instead of needing to manually export activities from Strava as a .gpx file to upload them here, users should be able to connect to their Strava account, then select the activity they want to use from a filterable list of their Strava activities. Once they select an activity, the app should automatically load the route onto the map and allow them to draw the bounding box. The rest of the app functionality should remain the same, and the export functionality should include the .gpx file data for the selected activity in order to fascilitate order fulfillment.

Strava provides some documentation about this:
