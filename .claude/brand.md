## Typography

### Streamlined Font System: Adventure Simplified

Our typography system has been simplified to two carefully chosen fonts that work together to create a cohesive, impactful brand experience while reducing complexity and improving performance.

#### Poppins (Hero & Brand Elements)
- **Google Fonts:** Full weight range (100-900, including italics)
- **Personality:** Bold, modern, impactful, condensed adventure energy
- **Usage:** Hero sections ("GET OUT THERE"), brand mantras, special callouts, condensed headlines
- **Styling:** Applied with ultra-condensed transforms (scaleX 0.85) and tight letter-spacing (-0.08em) for maximum impact
- **Why it works:** Creates powerful, mountain-peak-like vertical presence for key brand messaging while maintaining excellent readability

#### Trispace (Everything Else)
- **Google Fonts:** Available in 8 weights (100-800, including italics)
- **Personality:** Technical precision meets outdoor gear reliability, modern monospace aesthetic
- **Usage:** All headlines, body text, buttons, navigation, product descriptions, specifications
- **Styling:** Headlines use bold weight (700), body text uses regular weight with clean line spacing
- **Why it works:** Monospace character conveys precision and technical expertise perfect for GPS data and 3D printing, while providing distinctive character that sets us apart from typical outdoor brands
