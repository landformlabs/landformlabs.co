# Landform Labs FAQ

## What materials are used for the 3D prints?
We use high-quality PLA plastic for all our 3D prints, ensuring durability and a premium feel and finish. PLA is eco-friendly and biodegradable, making it a great choice for environmentally conscious adventurers.

## How do I submit my GPS data for a custom route print?
The easiest way to share is to provide a link to your activity on platforms like Strava, Garmin Connect, or Komoot. If you prefer, you can also email the .gpx file directly to sales@landformlabs.co

## How does the NFC feature work?
Each route tile comes with an embedded NFC chip. Simply tap your NFC-enabled smartphone to the tile in the corner indicated by the NFC icon on the back and it will link to your activity page (or whatever link you arranged during the order process).

## I don't have GPS data. Can I still order a custom print?
Absolutely! If you have a specific route in mind but don't have the GPS data, we can help you recreate it. Just provide us with the details of the route, and we'll work with you to create a custom print.

## What is the turnaround time for custom orders?
Turnaround time for custom orders is typically 1-2 weeks, depending on the complexity of the design and our current order volume. We will provide you with an estimated delivery date as we work through the details of the order.

## Do you accept returns or exchanges?
Due to the custom nature of our products, we do not accept returns or exchanges. However, if there is an issue with your order, please contact us at support@landformlabs.co and we will do our best to resolve it.
