# landformlabs.co

I have a current etsy shop at https://landformlabs.etsy.com. I have a domain namd landformlabs.co that currently uses Cloudfare to redirect to Etsy. However, I'd like to build out a dedicated site for Landform Labs. This site should include the following:
- A homepage that describes Landform Labs and what we do
- A product page that showcases our products with images, descriptions, and prices
- A blog page where we can post updates and articles related to our products and industry
- A contact page with a form for inquiries and our contact information
- Integration with Etsy for purchasing products
- A clean, modern design that is easy to navigate and mobile-friendly
- SEO optimization to help improve search engine rankings
- Social media integration to link to our social media profiles
- An about page that tells the story of Landform Labs and our mission
- A FAQ page to address common questions about our products and services
- A testimonials page to showcase customer reviews and feedback
- AI optimization with LLMs.txt for content generation and SEO
- Google analytics integration to track site traffic and user behavior

This site should be built using a modern web framework such as React or Next.js, and the plan is to use Vercel for hosting (assuming I can do so with the free tier). The site should be easy to update and maintain, with a content management system (CMS) such as Sanity or Contentful. The design should be visually appealing and reflect the brand identity of Landform Labs. Overall, the goal is to create a professional and user-friendly website that effectively showcases our products and helps drive sales through Etsy. Eventually, I want to transition to shopify for direct sales, but for now using Etsy for sales is fine.
