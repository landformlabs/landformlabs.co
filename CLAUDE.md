# landformlabs.co


I have a current etsy shop at https://landformlabs.etsy.com. I have a domain name landformlabs.co that currently uses Cloudfare to redirect to Etsy. However, I'd like to build out a dedicated site for Landform Labs. This site should include the following:
- A homepage that describes Landform Labs and what we do: See @.claude/about.md
- A product page that showcases our products with images, descriptions, and prices: See @.claude/products.md for a description of each product
- A contact page with a form for inquiries and our contact information
- Integration with Etsy for purchasing products
- A clean, modern design that is easy to navigate and mobile-friendly
- SEO optimization to help improve search engine rankings
- Social media integration to link to our social media profiles
- An about page that tells the story of Landform Labs and our mission: see @.claude/mission.md
- A FAQ page to address common questions about our products and services: see @.claude/faq.md
- A testimonials page to showcase customer reviews and feedback
- AI optimization with LLMs.txt for content generation and SEO
- Google analytics integration to track site traffic and user behavior

This is an ecommerce site. It should be built using a modern web framework such as React or Next.js, and the plan is to use Vercel for hosting (assuming I can do so with the free tier). The site should be easy to update and maintain, particularly product listing details. The design should be visually appealing and reflect the brand identity of Landform Labs (see @.claude/brand.md). Overall, the goal is to create a professional and user-friendly website that effectively showcases our products and helps drive sales through Etsy. Eventually, we will transition to shopify for direct sales, but for now using Etsy for sales is fine.

The following sites are inspirations for the design and functionality of the site:
